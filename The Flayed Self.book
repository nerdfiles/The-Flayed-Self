                                 Chapter 1


So it began there-in the idea that my Mother might be a robot. I wasn't much 
into Big Ideas, but if you treat all the existentialists in the world to a 
dinner party, you're bound to say that you invited all the existentialsts to 
a dinner party. Here you can see almost immediately why this cannot be that 
kind of book, and that I surely never found myself possessed by or with a 
very real, material object the of everyday world of bodies. One could say that 
even now, after having been introduced through an almost comedic variety of 
pathologically legislated cirumstances, anyone would find in themselves an 
aversion to percetion shattering theoretical constructs. In fact I doubt 
that it should appear as much opf a surprise to anyone that such concepts in-
and-of-themselves may even want naturally to be averted. Jennings

You see words themselves begin as a kind of limiting point to which I find 
other words contemptible. One word in, another word out. Much of the same 
process installs much of the same process before I find myself considering 
yet another word itself the chancellor of some new procession of much of the 
same. And no one single mentalizer has any of the same considersations as 
he himself proclaims to the hers and hims before herself turned about. Care-
fully it must be instigated whatever the same process is before one finds 
those exact same words compelling or even applicable, before some monarch 
all the same that process tells of one word, then the next.
